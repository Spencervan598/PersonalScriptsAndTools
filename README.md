# PersonalScriptsAndTools

Repo for scripts or tools I have created for myself. Some will be useful, some will be simple stuff I used to learn, like a calculator.

# checksumcheck.py
Compares a selected file's sha256sum with a input sum

# Conversion.py
Script I made so my brother can calculate CFM for ductwork. Possibly add more functionality if he or anyone is interested.

# Randompass.py
Generates password of specified length (12-16 characters). There are some bugs that need to be fixed. Specifically, when opting out of having special characters the password length is not as specified. Will fix next time I need to generate password without special characters.

# Calculator.py
Simple calculator with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
